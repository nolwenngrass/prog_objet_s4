# Simple-p6-Setup

This template contains all the things you need to get started with a clean and modern C++ project (formatter, linter, tests, continuous integration, etc.).
**It works on all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS).**

## Setting up

### Creating a repository

First, create your own repository based on this one. If you are using GitHub you can use this repository as a template:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45451201/217287736-20058d69-f0ed-40ff-b4e5-cfd852e2ba82.png)

Otherwise simply create a repository on your own and copy-paste all the files in this repo to your new repo.

**NB:** you might also want to change or remove the LICENSE file. Your project does not need to use the same license as the one we use for this template.

### Downloading your repository

Run this command inside the directory where you want to put this project:

```
git clone your_repo_url
```

### Compiling

If that is not already done, [install a compiler](https://julesfouchy.github.io/Learn--Clean-Code-With-Cpp/lessons/install-a-compiler/).

If that is not already done, [setup your IDE for C++ development](https://julesfouchy.github.io/Learn--Clean-Code-With-Cpp/lessons/ide/).

Once that is done, open the project folder in your IDE: it will detect the CMakeLists.txt file automatically and you can just run the project:

You should see this, with the circle following your mouse cursor:

🎉 Congrats you are **almost** done! But keep reading, we will now install amazing tools that will make your life so much easier!

### Clangd

First, you need to [install and setup _clangd_](https://julesfouchy.github.io/Learn--Clean-Code-With-Cpp/lessons/clangd/). It will provide even better C++ support than the default extensions, and is also required for the other tools to work.

### Formatter

[Setup clang-format](https://julesfouchy.github.io/Learn--Clean-Code-With-Cpp/lessons/formatting-tool/).

### Linter

[Setup clang-tidy](https://julesfouchy.github.io/Learn--Clean-Code-With-Cpp/lessons/static-analysers/).

## Coding

### Renaming the project

If you want to rename the project (called "Simple-p6-Setup" by default), you need to change it in 3 places:

- In the `CMakeLists.txt`, change the line `project(Simple-p6-Setup)`
- In the `.github/workflows/build_and_run_tests.yml`, change the line `TARGET: Simple-p6-Setup`
- In the `src/main.cpp`, change the line `auto ctx = p6::Context{{.title = "Simple-p6-Setup"}};`

### Folder structure

All your source files (.cpp) and header files (.hpp) need to go in the `src` folder. It is recommended to have the corresponding .cpp and .hpp next to each other:

```
src
   main.cpp
   some_folder
      some_file.cpp
      some_file.hpp
      another_file.cpp
      another_file.hpp
   another_folder
      a_third_file.cpp
      a_third_file.hpp
```

### p6

_p6_ is a 2D-drawing library that is designed to be extremely simple to use. In order to learn how to use it, [read their tutorials](https://julesfouchy.github.io/p6-docs/tutorials/the-context). (Note that you can skip the first chapter "Creating a project" as this template already does everything you need).

## Going further

### Writing tests

This template comes with the [Doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) testing library all set up.
You can simply write something like

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Addition is commutative")
{
    CHECK(1 + 2 == 2 + 1);
    CHECK(4 + 7 == 7 + 4);
}
```

in _any_ source file and the tests will run whenever you run your project. You will see their output in the console:

![tests-output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45451201/217270153-73d865d0-dc25-4176-b5eb-af2e9afb507e.png)

### Warnings as errors

Warnings are usually only considered as errors during the CI process (so that any warning is considered a failure and gets reported to you).
If you want to have warnings as errors in your local project too (typically in order to fix a warning shown by the CI):

- <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (to open VSCode's command palette)
- Search for `CMake: Edit CMake Cache (UI)`
- Turn `WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` ON and then save
